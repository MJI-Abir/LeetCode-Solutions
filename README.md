This repository houses my C++ solutions to various LeetCode problems.

## Goals

- 🧠 Sharpen problem-solving and algorithm skills.
- 👨🏽‍💻 Practice C++ programming and coding best practices.
- 🤖 Prepare for technical interviews.
- 🔍 Create a reference for future problem-solving.
- 🦾 Contribute to the LeetCode community.

## Structure

**problem_number.cpp:** Contains the C++ code for the solution.  
**Explanation.md:** Provides a detailed explanation of the approach and algorithm used, including time and space complexity analysis. (will try to add later for advanced problems)

## Usage

- Feel free to explore the solutions to understand different approaches.
- Use them as a reference when stuck on a problem or to compare your own solutions.
- Consider contributing your own solutions or improvements!

**HAPPY CODING! 😊**
